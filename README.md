# 🎨 ThermaToonPix

**ThermaToonPix** stands for **Thermal Vision**, **Cartoon**, and **Pixel Art Effects**.  
It is a lightweight and interactive media transformation tool that lets you apply cool visual effects — including heatmap simulation, cartoon-style rendering, and pixel art stylization — to **images**, **video files**, and **live webcam streams**.  

Built with **OpenCV** for backend processing and **Streamlit** for an intuitive web-based interface.
